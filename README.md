## Web Scraping Quotes - Data Analytics Internship Task

This project is a simple and effective Python-based web scraper that extracts inspirational quotes and their authors from [Quotes to Scrape](https://quotes.toscrape.com). It was completed as part of my Data Analytics internship with CodeAlpha.

---

## Objectives

- Learn and apply web scraping using Python
- Understand HTML structure and tags
- Convert unstructured data into a structured dataset
- Create a reusable script to generate datasets for analysis

## üîß Technologies Used

| Tool           | Purpose                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| `Python 3.x`   | Programming language              |
| `requests`     | Fetch HTML content from website   |
| `BeautifulSoup`| Parse and extract HTML elements   |
| `pandas`       | Create and export structured CSV  |
| `GitHub`       | Host and version-control project  |

---

## How It Works

1. The script sends a GET request to `https://quotes.toscrape.com`
2. It parses the HTML using BeautifulSoup
3. It finds all `<div class="quote">` elements
4. For each quote block, it extracts:
   - The quote text (`<span class="text">`)
   - The author's name (`<small class="author">`)
5. It stores the data into a `pandas` DataFrame
6. Finally, it exports the data to a CSV file named `quotes_dataset.csv`
